# HelloRust
Welcome to the HelloRust project! This project serves as an introductory guide to the Rust programming language, which is known for its performance, reliability, and productivity. Rust is designed to help developers create fast and secure software, with a strong emphasis on memory safety and concurrency.

The purpose of this project is to provide a starting point for learning Rust, offering practical examples and utilities that you can refer to as you continue to develop your Rust programming skills. Whether you are new to Rust or looking to refresh your knowledge, HelloRust aims to be a valuable resource for your journey.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To install Rust, you can use `rustup`, the Rust toolchain installer. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Download and install `rustup` by running the following command:

    ```sh
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
4. After installation, ensure that your `PATH` environment variable is configured correctly. You can do this by running:

    ```sh
    source $HOME/.cargo/env
    ```

For more detailed instructions, visit the [rustup website](https://rustup.rs/).
